2. **Create a New Issue**: If you plan to work on something that is not yet an open issue, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/netos-networks/netos-netbox.git/-/issues) first to discuss it with the maintainers.

3. **Commit Guidelines**: 
    - Write clear, concise commit messages.
    - Group related changes into a single commit.

    Example commit message:
    ```

    ```

4. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**:
    - Push your branch to your forked repository.
    - Create a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch of this repository.
    - Link the PR to the issue it addresses by using keywords like `Closes #123` in the PR description.
    - Use the appropriate [merge request template](.gitlab/merge_request_templates) for your PR.

## Code Style Guidelines

To maintain code consistency, please follow these style guidelines:
- Use [specific language or framework style guide] (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, ESLint for JavaScript).
- Write meaningful variable and function names.
- Include comments where necessary, especially for complex logic.

## Testing

Ensure that your code passes all tests before submitting a PR:
- Add tests for any new functionality.
- Run existing tests to ensure nothing is broken:
    ```bash
    # Command to run tests, e.g.,
    npm test
    ```

Update the documentation to reflect your changes:
- Add new or update existing documentation in the `docs/` directory.
